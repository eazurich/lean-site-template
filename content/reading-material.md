## Reading Material
<br>

A lot of material has been developed on effective altruism. Here is some of it.


For a short introduction, watch Will MacAskill's **[What are the most important moral problems of our time?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyprXhvGVYk&t=1s)** or check out **[any of the other TED talks and presentations on effective altruism](http://effective-altruism.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_EA_Presentations)**.


A great place to start is this **[introductory list on the EA forum](http://www.effective-altruism.com/ea/6x/introduction_to_effective_altruism/)**. Ryan Carey has also put this in a more detailed **[pdf format](http://www.careyryan.com/files/EA_Handbook.pdf)**.


Ben Kuhn compiles a great set of articles **[here](http://www.benkuhn.net/ea-reading)**.

A good primer on GiveWell, global poverty reduction (and charities in general): **[Giving 101: the basics](http://www.givewell.org/giving101)**


Peter McIntyre write a post summarising charity selection heuristics, and some cause areas: **[Effective charities 101](http://mcntyr.com/effective-charities-101/)**


How can you choose your career to help solve the world’s most pressing problems? 80 000 Hours has put together an **[incredible guide on careers](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/)**.


Additionally, many individual writers and other sites have interesting material on effective altruism – you can find some **[great blogs](https://eahub.org/links#blogs)** on the EA Hub.
