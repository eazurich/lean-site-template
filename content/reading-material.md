## Reading Material
<br>

A lot of material has been developed on effective altruism. Here is some of it.


For a short introduction, watch Will MacAskill's **[What are the most important moral problems of our time?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyprXhvGVYk&t=1s)**.

You can find a list of EA reading resources **[here](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/resources/)**, as well as a **[collection of excellent articles](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/)**.

The organization 80.000 hours have put together a thorough **[career guide](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/)** on how to tackle the world's most pressing problems. They also have a great **[podcast](https://80000hours.org/podcast/)**.

The **[EA forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/)** is a place for collaborative discussion on how to do the the most good.
